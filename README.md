# Bal覺kl覺ova Fish Auction Project

## Summary about project
This project is created by *IZTECH Students* in the Collaborators part. The project aims to create an online fish auction platform for Bal覺kl覺ova Cooperative Members. People can join auction for buying fish instead of being physically there. We have created an interface for Cooperative Head to present auction and sell fish as well.

### *The Architecture of the Implementation*
*MVC software architectural pattern* is used in the project. Controller classes act as an interface between database and view components to process all incoming requests, manipulate data using the model components. Service classes handle the necessary business logic and functions for the controller classes. Model classes correspond to all the necessary data that is stored and the needed data-related logic.

### *The Technologies*

---

### *Front-end Side*
We have used *Javascript programming language* and *React library* (they call themselves library not framework) to implement front-end. React is flexible due to component-based structure. Also it has a wide range of users (188k stars in Github Repo). Lastly, we have team members who have experience in ReactJS.

### *Server Side*
We have used *Java programming language* and *Spring Boot framework* to implement *back-end*. Spring is very flexible thanks to extensions and third party libraries. It simplifies and eases the process (Ex: Lombok getter-setter) greatly. Furthermore, Spring has *Inversion of Control* and *Dependency Injection* features so we focus on other stuff. Also, all team members have experience in Java.	

---

### *Storage Side*
We have used *MySql* on the *storage side*. MySql is a Relational Database Management System. We use it because it is free, has a high scalability option. Lastly, some of our team members have experience in MySql.

### Why Java-Spring framework?
1. Java programming language is easy to implement.
2. Java spring framework is understandable. 
3. Object-oriented manners can be implemented.
4. Active communities and quick debugging.
5. How to implement Java Spring framework? - Go to spring initializer web page

### Why javascript?
On many models with progress of technology, web applications required browser based dynamic models.
Using javascript will bring a new dynamic manner to application development.

---

### Why ssh?
SSH technology generally for remote controlling and testing the server. In this web application , tests and deployment  can be implemented in a remote server.
With ssh technology no one can access the remote machine who does not have the key.
Cyber resilience of the system is the most important thing for any kind of bad situation.
What is the Git Version Control System?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

---

### Why Git?
Working with a big devops team is exhaustive for collaboration and complicated when assignments are collected in the main project.
It is the best way to use the version control system for everyone in this project.
